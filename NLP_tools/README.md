For Homework 4 you will need to use the Standord Parser and the SENNA SRL parser. This folder contains two guides to getting started with these parsers.


For your projects, use any parser you like. In addition to Stanford's CoreNLP and SENNA, the SpaCy parser is a good choice, and it is designed to work with Python. SpaCy: https://spacy.io/  I have uploaded a small SpaCy demo.
