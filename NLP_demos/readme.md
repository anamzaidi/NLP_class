Here are some demos for using NLP techniques in Python, often with the help of NLTK. I will add more here as we cover topics in class.

In this folder:

- intro to NLTK
- 2-text processing
  (remove newlines, lower case, tokenize, remove stopwords, remove punctuation
- 3-normalizing text
  (sentenct tokenization, word tokenization, stem, lemmatize, part of speech tagging)
